## Mozilla Weekly Meeting Slideshow ##

This is a simple prototype for converting the Mozilla project-wide weekly meeting [wiki pages][] into slideshows.

This is potentially useful for two purposes:

  * We can display the slideshow on mounted screens and the Ten-Forward projection screen before weekly meetings start at Mozilla Offices to give Mozilla Employees ambient information about what's going on in the Mozilla Universe;
  
  * We can display the slideshow before the weekly meeting starts on [Air Mozilla][] to give remote community members the same ambient information;

  * [Jono][] can manually move through the slides on the Ten-Forward projection screen during the meeting itself as a visual aid;

  * The full power of the Web can be used to potentially make meeting information easier to digest and understand.

Note that the code is currently very hacked-together and doesn't do a lot of things that it ought to, such as:

  * Allowing manual control of slide movement.
  * Actually providing a reasonable amount of time to read a slide's content before moving on to the next one.
